# Classification Models - Machine Learning :rocket:

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating classification models using various machine learning algorithms. The classification tasks include predicting outcomes based on features, and the models implemented are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.

## Algorithms Used :gear:
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **Logistic Regression**

## Libraries Used :books:
